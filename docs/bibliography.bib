abstract = {As cryptographic proofs have become essentially unverifiable, cryptographers have argued in favor of developing techniques that help tame the complexity of their proofs. Game-based techniques provide a popular approach in which proofs are structured as sequences of games and in which proof steps establish the validity of transitions between successive games. Code-based techniques form an instance of this approach that takes a code-centric view of games, and that relies on programming language theory to justify proof steps. While code-based techniques contribute to formalize the security statements precisely and to carry out proofs systematically, typical proofs are so long and involved that formal verification is necessary to achieve a high degree of confidence. We present Certicrypt, a framework that enables the machine-checked construction and verification of code-based proofs. Certicrypt is built upon the general-purpose proof assistant Coq, and draws on many areas, including probability, complexity, algebra, and semantics of programming languages. Certicrypt provides certified tools to reason about the equivalence of probabilistic programs, including a relational Hoare logic, a theory of observational equivalence, verified program transformations, and game-based techniques such as reasoning about failure events. The usefulness of Certicrypt is demonstrated through various examples, including a proof of semantic security of OAEP (with a bound that improves upon existing published results), and a proof of existential unforgeability of FDH signatures. Our work provides a first yet significant step towards Halevi's ambitious programme of providing tool support for cryptographic proofs.},

It aims to bridge the gap between interactive and automated theorem proving, by situating automated tools and methods in a framework that supports user interaction and the construction of fully specified axiomatic proofs. Lean is an ongoing and long-term effort, but it already provides many useful components, integrated development environments, and a rich API which can be used to embed it into other systems. It is currently being used to formalize category theory, homotopy type theory, and abstract algebra. We describe the project goals, system architecture, and main features, and we discuss applications and continuing work.",

abstract="Previously known techniques to construct pairing-friendly curves of prime or near-prime order are restricted to embedding degree {\$}k {\backslash}leqslant 6 {\$}. More general methods produce curves over {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb F{\}}{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve $\rho$ ≡ log(p)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing operations need no more than {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathbb F{\}}{\_}{\{}p^4{\}}{\$}arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one third of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize $\rho$; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} (q--3)/(q--1) enables building curves with $\rho$ {\textasciitilde} q/(q--1).",

Such is the case of elliptic curve groups whose embedding degree is large enough to maintain a good security level, but small enough for arithmetic operations to be feasible. However, the embedding degree for most elliptic curves is enormous, and the few previously known suitable elliptic curves have embedding degree k ≤ 6. In this paper, we examine criteria for curves with larger k that generalize prior work by Miyaji et al. based on the properties of cyclotomic polynomials, and propose efficient representations for the underlying algebraic structures.",

isbn = {9781109444506},
publisher = {Stanford University},
address = {Stanford, CA, USA},
abstract = {We propose the first fully homomorphic encryption scheme, solving an old open problem. Such a scheme allows one to compute arbitrary functions over encrypted data without the decryption key—i.e., given encryptions  E (  m  1), ...,  E (  m t ) of  m  1, ...,  m  t,  one can efficiently compute a compact ciphertext that encrypts  f (  m  1, ...,  m  t ) for any efficiently computable function  f . Fully homomorphic encryption has numerous applications. For example, it enables encrypted search engine queries—i.e., a search engine can give you a succinct encrypted answer to your (boolean) query without even knowing what your query was. It also enables searching on encrypted data; you can store your encrypted data on a remote server, and later have the server retrieve only files that (when decrypted) satisfy some boolean constraint, even though the server cannot decrypt the files on its own. More broadly, it improves the efficiency of secure multiparty computation. In our solution, we begin by designing a somewhat homomorphic "boostrappable" encryption scheme that works when the function  f  is  the scheme's own decryption function.  We then show how, through recursive self-embedding, bootstrappable encryption gives fully homomorphic encryption.},
